## Why tpb-cli ? ðŸ¤·

Nowadays surfing though piratebay websites is a messy task ðŸ˜«.
Every time we click on something on the website, we'll get fired with stupid ads. 
Only on the 3rd or 4th click, the intended task get executed. 

Due to this, downloading a file's magnet takes approximately more than 2 minutes, plus our bandwidth will be misused 
for the stupid ads. ðŸ˜
