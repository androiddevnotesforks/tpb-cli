## Why tpb-cli ? ðŸ¤·

Surfing through piratebay been a messy task ðŸ˜«.
Every time we click on something, we end up looking at an Ad. Only on the 3rd or 4th click, we'll get navigated to the real link.

Due to this, finding a file's magnet takes approximately more than 2 minutes, plus our bandwidth will be misused for the stupid ads. ðŸ˜
